Version numbers
---------------

Atom uses the common "Linux kernel" versioning system, where even-numbered minor versions are stable and odd-numbered minor versions are development snapshots.

The micro version indicates the origin of the release: even micro numbers are only used for released archives; odd micro numbers are only used on the Git repository.

A stable series means that the command-line options and the interactive keyboard controls should not change much for all tags whose version number start with the same major-minor numbers. Some new features might be developped in that branch, but each release should be backward-compatible with their ancestor. Releases from a stable series should be use for production. 

In contrast, unstable branches consist of tags which are developer snapshots. They are not expected to be compatible with any other version. Some features might change between different stable branches.


Installing
----------

This library uses the GNU Autotools. It should be easy to build and install it like this:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
gg
NOTE: If building from a git checkout, you should run ./autogen.sh first.

On GNU/Linux, you need to install the following software: 
 * The GNU Autotools
 * liblo-dev
